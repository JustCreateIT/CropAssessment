		<p>This tool has been created in collaboration between <b>Onions New Zealand</b>, <b>Plant & Food Research</b> and <b>LandWise Inc.</b> and has been designed around the concept of Management Action Zones with the intention of assisting growers to identify and map the variability within their onion crop.</p>
		<p><b>Management Action Zones</b> identify areas that are performing differently within a crop and separate the influences of population, growth and natural variability.</p>

		<p>By providing an estimation of yield and an understanding of the causes of the variability, such as low population and/or low growth rate, at an early stage, it is hoped that the grower will be able to make more informed decisions on how to manage the crop during the season, and into the future, to maximise profitablity.</p>
