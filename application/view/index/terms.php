		<p>It is intended to assist growers with identifying and mapping the variability within their onion crop. By providing an estimation of yield and an understanding of the causes of the variability, such as low population or low growth rate, at an early stage, it is hoped that the grower will be able to make informed decisions on how to manage the crop during the season to maximise profitablity.</p>
